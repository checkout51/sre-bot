# Progress for SRE Assistant Agent

## What Works

1. **Core Agent Framework**: The basic agent structure is set up with Google ADK.
   - Root agent configuration
   - SRE agent with Gemini model integration
   - Kubernetes sub-agent with specialized tools

2. **Kubernetes Tools**: A comprehensive set of Kubernetes interaction tools have been implemented:
   - Listing resources (namespaces, deployments, pods, services, etc.)
   - Getting detailed information about resources
   - Scaling deployments
   - Retrieving pod logs
   - Checking resource health
   - Retrieving Kubernetes events

3. **Utility Functions**: Basic utility functions for loading instructions from files.

## What's Left to Build

1. **Containerization**: 
   - Dockerfile for building the application container
   - Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment
   - Container-specific configuration and environment setup

2. **Additional Tool Modules**:
   - Monitoring system integration (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog)
   - Log aggregation system integration
   - Cloud provider-specific tools (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - Incident management system integration

3. **Enhanced Documentation**:
   - Detailed API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Deployment guides
   - Troubleshooting information

4. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for tools and utilities
   - Integration tests for the agent
   - End-to-end testing with a Kubernetes cluster

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure credential management
   - Audit logging

## Progress Status

The project is in the early development stage. The core functionality for Kubernetes interaction is implemented, but the project needs containerization, additional tool modules, comprehensive testing, and enhanced documentation before it can be considered production-ready.

Current focus: Containerizing the application to make it easier to deploy and use.
